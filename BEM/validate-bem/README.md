### Validate BEM

A 'package.json' template with several scripts and settings.

Use the 'npm run all' script to run all validation scripts at once. I will extend these rules and scripts to check more scenarios.

Use the 'npm run postcss-import' to combine all CSS files into a single file (and check it on a public validation service).

The ESLint, StyleLint, PostCSS, HTML Validate, HTML Validator are used to validate HTML and CSS by BEM rules.
