My experiments with CBR exchange rates: I want to create transparent proxy and add new API that returns JSON with UTF-8 encoding.

Project was generated by [Tutorial: Create a minimal web API with ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/min-web-api?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio-code): 'dotnet new webapi -minimal -o MinimalWebApi' and soon.

.editorconfig was created by 'dotnet new editorconfig': I changed 'csharp_new_line_before_open_brace = all' to 'none'
