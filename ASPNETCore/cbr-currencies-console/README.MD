Few approaches to read CBR exchange rates ("https://www.cbr.ru/scripts/XML_daily.asp"): I wanted to create a console application that will read and use rates.

Project was generated as described at [Tutorial: Create a .NET console application using Visual Studio Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/with-visual-studio-code?pivots=dotnet-6-0): 'dotnet new console --framework net6.0' and so on.

.editorconfig was created by 'dotnet new editorconfig': I changed 'csharp_new_line_before_open_brace = all' to 'none'
